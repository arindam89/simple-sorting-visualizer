## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the Flask server:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

## Usage

1. Enter numbers separated by commas in the input field or use the "Generate Random Array" button.
2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Adjust the animation speed using the slider.
4. Click the "Sort" button to visualize the sorting process.
5. Use the "Compare Algorithms" button to see performance comparisons between different algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this visualizer:

- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort

Each algorithm comes with detailed information about its time complexity, space complexity, and a brief description.
